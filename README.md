Data Extracting LLM Project 

This project aims to facilitate the extraction of structured data from PDF documents using a Language Model (LLM). Leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, the tool automates the extraction process, allowing users to convert unstructured PDF data into structured and usable formats.
